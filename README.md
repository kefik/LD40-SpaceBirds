# LD40-SpaceBirds
An ambient game for Ludum Dare 40, theme: The more you have, the worse it is,

## Trivia

My goal was to play around with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/), version 2.1.4. Never used it before.
Unfortunately, I had much less time than originally planned; created in aprox. 9 hours.

In the end, I've struck some inefficiency in Godot that sometimes make the game tearing a lot;
could not get around it (everything is pooled, no GC). Partially, I think the mouse mode is
to blame... just a gist.

Try to be calm and contemplative, almost meditation-like, when you play the game.

I hope you enjoy it.

## Run
