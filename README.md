# LD40-SpaceBirds
An ambient game for Ludum Dare 40, theme: The more you have, the worse it is,

## Trivia

My goal was to play around with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/), version 2.1.4. Never used it before.
Unfortunately, I had much less time than originally planned; created in aprox. 9 hours.

Beware: 40k simple math operations per frame is a bit too much for GDScript...

Try to be calm and contemplative, almost meditation-like, when you play the game.

I hope you enjoy it.

## Run

Windows build only; download the archive [SpaceBirds-Win64.rar](/Build/WSpaceBirds-Win64.rar), unpack it and run SpaceBirds.exe from within SpaceBirds-Win64 folder.
